# Tyrants Universe: A Fully-Realized Civilizational Framework for My Future Novel

## Repo Introduction
This is the place where I systemically organize and share the progressing framework of my novel, the work in progress name is Tyrants. You will know why.  
The files may not have a consistent language in them. It will vary between English, Chinese, French, and my fictional language with a totally different grammar as needed.  
As per my previous need to share with friend, some raw documents were written in Chinese.  
For the purpose of getting most feedbacks and contributions, I will try to keep a mainly English version of each main file.  
Also because markdown readability is really a pain for heavily text-based projects, I will forgo the version control and use word documents.  

## Overview
Tyrants Universe is a hard science fiction through:
- everything needs to make sense, things needs to have logical validity to exist, and have purpose to be created at all
- interstellar civilizations and societies with social norms that are derived from speculated philosophical advancements that revamps old beliefs, reflected on language and other aspects
- logical legal/political infrastructure, economic activities and interstellar logistics
- highly theoretical physics weapons and future military logistics, economic and intel deployments, tactical rollouts, instead of Hollywood style pew pew orgy without formations and roles, or battlefield depth and width. Like come on, human already used formations, traps and specialized roles when they were hunting mammoths, and highly organized by Rome/Chinese Warring States era, no war was ever fought in mud pits with messy dance raves.
- I do have some pretty cool weapons though, so the wars are still interesting and have actions.

## Goal
To write the novel. Duh.
To refine this universe with feedback from linguists, economists, legal scholars, physisists (I really need to know if my weapons would work or not), sci-fi writers, and speculative designers.

## Several Interesting Concepts
- **A whole new governance model**: An informed civic-participation based, audit-heavy and somewhat decentralize governance model based on meritocracy.
- **A whole new language**: A naturalistic function-based conlang with grammar inspired from several languages and the philosophical ideas. Aimed for clarity and efficiency, might be good for multi-part, multi-agent and structure-heavy disciplines. Also quite machine readable for a natuarl language.
- **Lifeforms and related settings**: Ranging from clones, cyber-augmented humans, to self-aware AI collectives. They will have motives and designs that actually make sense in real world, and issues on how much rights do they get according to their unique traits.
- **Overall, a universe that actually could exist**: Self-correcting worldbuilding with resource balancing, internal contradictions, and systemic stress simulation.

## Project Layout
See [World_Structure.md](lore/World_Structure.md) for full map.

- `world settings/`: core world documents. Including philosophies, government bodies, economic systems (mostly descriptive rather than modelized because it's a post-scarcity, hyper-rational world and our economic models don't apply), military settings and more.
- `language/`: linguistic structure of Republic Standard (共和国标准语). Separated for the convenience of managing glossery.
- `docs/`: diagrams, maps, infographics.
- `proposals/`: feedback folders by domain.
