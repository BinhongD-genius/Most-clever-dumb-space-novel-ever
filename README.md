# Tyrants Universe: A Fully-Realized Civilizational Framework for My Future Novel

## Repo Introduction
This is the place where I systemically organize and share the progressing framework of my novel, the work in progress name is Tyrants. You will know why.  
The files may not have a consistent language in them. It will vary between English, Chinese, French, and my fictional language with a totally different grammar as needed.  
As per my previous need to share with friend, some raw documents were written in Chinese.  
For the purpose of getting most feedbacks and contributions, I will try to keep a mainly English version of each main file.  
Also because markdown readability is really a pain for heavily text-based projects, I will forgo the version control and use word documents.  

## Overview
Tyrants Universe is a hard science fiction meta-civilization design that simulates advanced interstellar societies through:
- rigorously constructed languages,
- economically viable interplanetary trade and travel systems,
- logical legal/political infrastructure,
- highly theoretical physics weapons and future military logistics,
- and a socioculturally plausible divergence from Earth norms.

## Goal
To write the novel. Duh.
To refine this universe with feedback from linguists, economists, legal scholars, sci-fi writers, and speculative designers.

## Several Interesting Concepts
- **A whole new governance model**: An informed civic-participation based, audit-heavy and somewhat decentralize governance model based on meritocracy.
- **A whole new language**: A naturalistic function-based conlang with grammar inspired from several languages and the philosophical ideas. Aimed for clarity and efficiency, might be good for multi-part, multi-agent and structure-heavy disciplines. Also quite machine readable for a natuarl language.
- **Lifeforms and related settings**: Ranging from clones, cyber-augmented humans, to self-aware AI collectives. They will have motives and designs that actually make sense in real world, and issues on how much rights do they get according to their unique traits.
- **Overall, a universe that actually could exist**: Self-correcting worldbuilding with resource balancing, internal contradictions, and systemic stress simulation.
